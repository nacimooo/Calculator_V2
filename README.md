# Big New Features!
The new version of the Calculator app is better in every way!
With new features such as:
- Support for trignomentric calculation
- Support for more Mathematical operations
- A new and improved UI
- Lays the foundation for almost limitless features

Future Features:
As far the calculator itself goes, there isn't much I want to add other than the Misc tab.
The last thing I will be doing towards the end of this project will be to clean up the awful spaghetti code in some places.
